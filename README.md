I was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine. My dad was an executive working for the Soviet space program, and my mom was a civil engineer. 


At the age of 9 I was lucky to get a really good math teacher, a girl just out of college, that kempt feeding me fun math problems, to solve. This ended up determining my entire life.

I ended up spending my school years participating in different math and physics competitions and reading books of Richard Feynman
